        <h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:60px">A Daydreamer</h1>
        <p>&quot;Daydreamer&quot; is probably the word that best describes me. If you&apos;ve ever watched school-life anime, you&apos;ve likely seen the cool, aloof main character sitting in the corner of the classroom, gazing out the window as his thoughts drift away with the clouds. That was me back in school&ndash;though without the &quot;cool and handsome&quot; part :>.</p>

  <p>From a young age, I loved letting my mind wander through my own imagination. As a child, I dreamed of being the Red Power Ranger who saves the world. I&apos;d grab a dry tree branch and play with my friends, pretending to fight monsters. We played in the rubber plantation, striking the trees as if they were enemies, sometimes hitting so hard the sap would ooze out.</p>

  <p>In class, my head was rarely in the lessons. I was busy thinking about how to upgrade my Gunny weapon to +10, replaying last night&apos;s Crossfire match, or recalling the Doraemon episode I had watched that morning.</p>

  <p>By middle school, my dreams shifted to League of Legends. I&apos;d replay mistakes in my mind to prepare for the next match, or sometimes just blame my teammates for being bad. I also daydreamed about having my crush someday, we will go out together, always staying by each other&apos;s side.</p>

  <p>High school came, and I was still staring out the window, lost in thought. I dreamed of winning first place in the national math contest, competing internationally, and earning a scholarship to study abroad. I dreamed of my class being the best&ndash;not only in academics, but also in sports and unity.</p>

  <p>That&apos;s probably why people often called me carefree. I spent most of my time lost in imagination rather than sharing or opening up to friends. I rarely joined sports or fun activities, so I knew less about &quot;real life&quot; than my peers. Even so, I still did well in school. Thanks to my natural logical thinking, I managed to score high on exams despite being distracted in class. Maybe I was just lucky to be gifted with that ability&ndash;though only in academics.</p>

  <p>University, however, was a turning point. Logical thinking alone wasn&apos;t enough anymore. I dreamed of becoming a great AI scientist. I downloaded thousand-page reference books and tried to study them diligently, believing that if I read carefully enough, I would achieve both high scores and deep understanding. But the books were too long, the knowledge too vast, and I couldn&apos;t keep up before exams. The result: low grades, unfinished books, and frustration.</p>

  <p>Because of this dream, I bought even more thick AI textbooks&ndash;so heavy they could probably injure someone if dropped! But aside from reading and doing the exercises, I didn&apos;t push myself further. I didn&apos;t try to build simple AI models, didn&apos;t seek out professors, and didn&apos;t join labs to gain practical experience. Eventually, I got lost in the sea of knowledge: I could understand it in theory, but I didn&apos;t know what to do with it. My university record suffered as a result.</p>

  <p>I had a close friend from high school who often teased me for living in a &quot;pink world,&quot; while I thought he lived in a &quot;gray&quot; one. His perspective always seemed pessimistic to me. But by my fifth year, I began to realize he wasn&apos;t wrong&ndash;I had indeed taken life too lightly. I used to think life was simple, like a straight road. Now I understand that each person has their own way of seeing the world, and that listening to others can only enrich our own perspective.</p>

  <p>Even now, I remain something of a daydreamer. But I am also more awake than before.</p>

  <p>As the title suggests, I am a daydreamer. Yet I have also fought, in my own way, to pursue the dream of becoming a great AI scientist&ndash;even if fears and doubts still linger. So, I ask myself: do I not still deserve to be called a &quot;dreamer&quot;?</p>
